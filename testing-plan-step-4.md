# Testing Plan for Step 4: User Data Synchronization

## Webhook Testing
1. Create a new user in Clerk and verify:
   - The user is correctly created in the database
   - Default preferences are initialized
   - Initial credits are allocated

2. Update a user in Clerk (change name/avatar) and verify:
   - The changes are reflected in the database

## API Testing
1. Test the `/api/users` endpoint with:
   - Authenticated user (should return profile)
   - Unauthenticated request (should return 401)

## Server Actions Testing
1. Test `getCurrentUser()`:
   - Sign in and verify it returns the correct profile
   - Sign out and verify it returns null

2. Test `updateCurrentUserProfile()`:
   - Update display name and verify changes persist
   - Try invalid updates and verify error handling

3. Test `getCurrentUserPreferences()` and `updateCurrentUserPreferences()`:
   - Verify preferences are retrieved correctly
   - Update preferences and verify changes persist

## Auth Helper Testing
1. Test `getCurrentClerkId()` and `isAuthenticated()`:
   - When signed in
   - When not signed in

2. Test `getCurrentUserWithDb()`:
   - Verify it correctly fetches both Clerk user and DB user

## Manual Testing Notes
- If any tests fail, document the specific error and conditions
- Keep track of any edge cases discovered during testing

## Next Steps
After completing these tests successfully:
1. Fix any issues discovered during testing
2. Document any necessary changes to the implementation
3. Proceed to Step 5: Set up essential Shadcn UI components
